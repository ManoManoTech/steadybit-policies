# Steadybit-policies
ManoMano public policies to define resiliency expectations.
This repository aims to write our own policy using [steadybit definitions](https://github.com/steadybit/definitions).

# Usage
The policy file can be linked to a service definition in [steadybit](https://www.steadybit.com/) or with the [steadybit cli](https://github.com/steadybit/cli).

If you are interested by the subject, please feel free to reach the pulse team.


# Requirements
A platform with steadybit, [documentation for reference](https://www.steadybit.com/docs/learn/60-resilience-expectations).
